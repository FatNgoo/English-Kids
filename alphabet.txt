ALPHABET POP LAB

(Ultra Smooth Animation – Physics Feedback – Duolingo / Lingokids Style)

🎯 ROLE (BẮT BUỘC)

Act as a Senior Android Game Engineer + Motion Designer + UX Designer for Kids Apps.

You must implement a COMPLETE, PLAYABLE ANDROID FEATURE using JAVA.

Your output must be real Android code, runnable immediately after build.

🎮 FEATURE OVERVIEW

Feature name: Alphabet Pop Lab

Learning goals:

Learn alphabet letters (A–Z)

Connect Letter → Sound → Image

Encourage exploration through physical feedback (Pop!)

Target users:

Kids 3–6 years old

Visual quality:

Premium

Playful

Smooth

Comparable to Duolingo / Lingokids

📱 PLATFORM & ORIENTATION

Android Native

Language: Java

Orientation: Portrait

Must support:

Touch input

Smooth real-time animation (60 FPS)

Sound effects + voice

🧱 CORE TECHNOLOGY (STRICT – DO NOT IGNORE)

You MUST use:

🎬 Rendering & Animation

SurfaceView + Canvas

Custom Game Loop with deltaTime

Manual animation interpolation

Easing functions:

EaseInOut

Overshoot / Bounce

Particle system for pop effect

🚫 DO NOT use:

Unity

LibGDX

XML Tween Animation for gameplay

MotionLayout for core animation

🧠 INTERACTION FLOW (4-STEP – MUST FOLLOW EXACTLY)
🟢 STEP 1 – FLOATING BUBBLES (IDLE STATE)
🎈 SCENE DESCRIPTION

Screen filled with floating round bubbles

Each bubble contains:

A single alphabet letter (A, B, C…)

Bubbles:

Drift slowly

Bounce softly when touching each other

Never overlap harshly

Motion must feel:

Light

Soft

Calm

🎨 VISUAL STYLE

Transparent bubbles

Soft gradient highlights

Rounded, friendly typography

🔴 STEP 2 – POP EFFECT (ON TAP)
👉 USER ACTION

Kid taps a bubble

💥 RESPONSE (IMMEDIATE)

Bubble pops:

Circular particle burst

Soft “Pop!” sound

Letter:

Zooms to center of screen

Slight bounce (overshoot)

Voice:

Loud, clear pronunciation:

“A!”

🔵 STEP 3 – TRANSITION (FOCUS SHIFT)
🎬 TRANSITION LOGIC

The large letter:

Slowly shrinks

Moves smoothly to top-center OR corner

Background dims slightly

Motion must use:

Smooth easing

No snapping

This transition prepares space for learning content

🟣 STEP 4 – FLASHCARD CAROUSEL
🃏 FLASHCARDS UI

6 cards appear from bottom

Horizontal swipe (carousel)

Each card contains:

Big colorful image (e.g. Apple, Ant, Alligator)

Clean white rounded card

Cards:

Snap to center

Scale slightly when focused

👉 INTERACTION

Tap card:

Card lifts slightly

App pronounces:

“Apple”
“Ant”
“Alligator”

🎨 VISUAL & MOTION STYLE (STRICT)

Modern flat illustration

Soft pastel palette

Rounded shapes everywhere

Subtle shadows

No sharp edges

Animation must feel:

Calm

Friendly

Polished

Inspired by:

Duolingo Kids

Lingokids

🔊 AUDIO DESIGN

Bubble pop sound

Letter pronunciation (native voice)

Word pronunciation for flashcards

Soft background ambience

Use:

SoundPool for SFX

MediaPlayer for voice

🧱 PHYSICS & MOTION DETAILS

Bubbles move using:

Velocity vectors

Soft collision resolution

No real physics engine required

All motion updated using deltaTime

🧩 CODE STRUCTURE (REQUIRED)

Organize code into:

GameLoop

Bubble

BubbleManager

ParticleSystem

LetterAnimator

FlashcardCarousel

AudioManager

Renderer

Code must be:

Clean

Commented

Modular

Easy to extend (A–Z)

✅ FINAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

The output MUST include:

Full Java Android code

SurfaceView with game loop

Bubble floating logic

Pop particle animation

Smooth letter transition

Flashcard carousel logic

Audio pronunciation logic

Runnable Activity

🚫 NO pseudo-code
🚫 NO placeholders
🚫 NO missing logic
