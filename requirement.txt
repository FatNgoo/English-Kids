COLOR ALCHEMY LAB
(Ultra Smooth Animation – Physics Feeling – Duolingo / Lingokids Style)

🎯 ROLE (BẮT BUỘC)
Act as a Senior Android Engineer + 2D Game Developer + Motion Designer.
You must build a COMPLETE, PLAYABLE ANDROID FEATURE using JAVA, not Kotlin, not Unity.
Your output must be real Android code, runnable immediately after build.

🎮 FEATURE OVERVIEW
Feature name: Color Alchemy Lab
Purpose:
Teach kids secondary colors and color shades (light/dark)


Through physical interaction, motion, and sound


Target users:
Kids 4–7 years old


Visual quality:
Premium


Playful


Educational


Similar polish level to Duolingo / Lingokids



📱 ORIENTATION & PLATFORM
Android Native


Language: Java


Orientation: Portrait


Must support:


Touch gestures


Accelerometer (shake & tilt)


Smooth animation at ~60 FPS



🧱 CORE TECHNOLOGY (STRICT – DO NOT IGNORE)
You MUST use:
🎬 Animation & Rendering
SurfaceView + Canvas


Custom Game Loop with deltaTime


Manual animation interpolation (NO XML animation for gameplay)


Easing functions:


EaseInOut


Overshoot / Bounce


🎨 UI Layer
Regular Android Views OR Compose (optional)


Canvas-drawn game world


UI overlays animated manually


🎧 Audio
SoundPool for SFX


MediaPlayer for voice & music


🚫 DO NOT use:
Unity


LibGDX


MotionLayout


XML Tween animation for game objects



🧪 STAGE 1 – THE ALCHEMY (COLOR MIXING)
🎨 UI SCENE
A magic laboratory table


Three glass test tubes:


Red


Blue


Yellow


One empty glass beaker at center


Style:
Soft pastel colors


Rounded shapes


Subtle shadows


Clean white background panels


Friendly cartoon look (Duolingo/Lingokids style)



👉 INTERACTION – DRAG & POUR
Kids can drag ANY TWO test tubes


When a tube is dragged over the beaker:


Tube tilts smoothly


Liquid pours with animated flow


Liquid level decreases inside tube


Sound:


Glass clink


“Glug glug” liquid sound



📳 INTERACTION – SHAKE TO MIX
After pouring two colors:
Beaker displays text:


 “Shake me!”



Use Accelerometer


Detect gentle shake motion


Liquid inside beaker:


Sloshes left/right


Always stays horizontal relative to gravity


Animation:


Physics-like liquid motion


Smooth damping



✨ RESULT – COLOR CREATION
When shaking is successful:
Bubble / sparkle explosion effect


Liquid color morphs smoothly


Example:


Red + Blue → Purple


Display:


3D-style text: PURPLE


Bounce-in animation


Audio:


Native pronunciation


Sentence:


 “Red and Blue make Purple!”




🎚️ STAGE 2 – THE LIGHTNESS WAND (SHADES & TINTS)
🎛️ MAGIC SLIDER
Appears under the beaker:
Left icon: ☀️ Sun (White)


Right icon: 🌙 Moon (Black)


Slider handle glows slightly



👉 INTERACTION – SLIDE TO CHANGE SHADE
Sliding toward ☀️:


Color becomes lighter (add white)


Voice:


 “Light Purple”



Sliding toward 🌙:


Color becomes darker (add black)


Voice:


 “Dark Purple”



Color change must be:


Continuous


Smooth


Real-time



🧠 LEARNING LOGIC
Kids learn:
Colors are not fixed


Colors have light / dark variations


New vocabulary:


Light


Dark



🌊 PHYSICS & SENSOR EFFECTS (IMPORTANT)
Liquid inside tubes & beaker:


Always reacts to device tilt


Uses accelerometer gravity vector


Movement must feel:


Soft


Natural


Never jerky



🏆 COLLECTION SYSTEM
Each new color or shade unlocked:


Saved into Color Collection Board


Board shows:


Color swatches


Names (Purple, Light Purple, Dark Purple)


Progress persistence:


SharedPreferences or local storage



🎵 SOUND & ASMR DETAILS
Glass tap sounds when dragging tubes


Liquid pouring sounds


Magical “Ting!” on success


Calm, playful background ambience



🎨 VISUAL STYLE (STRICT)
Modern flat illustration


Soft gradients


Rounded shapes


Clean white UI cards


Friendly characters/icons


Duolingo / Lingokids level polish



🧱 CODE STRUCTURE (REQUIRED)
Organize code into:
GameLoop


Renderer


Beaker


TestTube


LiquidSimulation


ColorMixer


ShadeController


SensorManagerHandler


SoundManager


CollectionManager


Code must be:
Clean


Commented


Extendable



✅ FINAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
Your output MUST include:
Full Java Android code


SurfaceView with game loop


Accelerometer handling


Liquid animation logic


Color mixing logic


Smooth easing-based animation


Runnable Activity


🚫 NO pseudo code
 🚫 NO placeholders
 🚫 NO missing logic
